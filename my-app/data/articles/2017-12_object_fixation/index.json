Jesse has developed a plugin for Pupil that enables a prosthetic hand to form grasps based on what the wearer is fixating on in the scene in real-time on the CPU (10-15 fps)!</p>\n<p>This plugin was developed as part of a project called <a href=\"https://www.jesseweisberg.com/therabotics/\">Therabotics</a>. Therabotics was created by a team of graduate students at Washington University in St. Louis to explore how computer vision can be used to improve prosthetic hand control.</p>\n<p>This project is a great demonstration of how to extend Pupil and contribute back to the open source community!</p>\n<div class=\"Feature-video-container-16by9\">\n  <iframe class=\"Feature-video u-padTop--2\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYcfLEvbxSc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"small u-padBottom--2\">Robotic Prosthetic Hand Controlled with Object Recognition and Eye-Tracking</div>\n\n<p>The object detection plugin publishes the detected object that is closest to the fixation to a rostopic. An Ardunio Mega 2560 subscribes to the rostopic and controls the linear actuators in an OpenBionics 3D printed hand to form a predefined grasp that is associated with the detected object.</p>\n<p>Check out Jesse’s Pupil fork on <a href=\"https://github.com/jesseweisberg/pupil\">github</a>. He provides a very well written readme along with demo videos. Or jump straight to his “object detector app” in his <a href=\"https://github.com/jesseweisberg/pupil/tree/master/pupil_src/shared_modules/object_detector_app\">repo</a>.</p>\n<p>We hope that others will build on top of Jesse’s work and contribute back to his project!</p>\n<p>Finally, if you have built something with Pupil, please consider sharing with the community via chat on <a href=\"https://pupil-labs.com/chat\">DiscordApp</a>.</p>\n","updatedAt":"2018-01-26T09:06:41.708Z","article":"2017-12_object_fixation"}]
