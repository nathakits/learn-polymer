We designed and developed this camera from the ground up. This camera is flexible, small, and fast and will become an integral component in the Pupil eye tracking hardware ecosystem. </p>\n<p>200hz eye camera features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Global shutter - Improves pupil detection. </li>\n<li>Faster - Capture 200 x 200 pixels at 200fps. You can also capture at 400x400 at 120fps. </li>\n<li>Smaller - Cameras are much smaller. So small that they are barely visible to the wearer.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"Feature-image-wrapper\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n    <img src=\"../../../../media/images/store_additional_products/e200upgrade.jpg\" style=\"width:50%;text-align:center;\" class='Feature-image--software u-padBottom--2' alt=\"Pupil Labs 200hz eye camera upgrade\"/>\n</div>\n\n<p>We’re rolling out the new camera updates for Pupil eye tracking headsets first. Over the next few weeks, we will be releasing updates for our VR/AR add-ons. Coming soon - the long awaited Oculus CV1 add-on!</p>\n<p>Purchase a new Pupil headset with a 200hz eye camera or upgrade any existing Pupil headset!

Jesse has developed a plugin for Pupil that enables a prosthetic hand to form grasps based on what the wearer is fixating on in the scene in real-time on the CPU (10-15 fps)!</p>\n<p>This plugin was developed as part of a project called <a href=\"https://www.jesseweisberg.com/therabotics/\">Therabotics</a>. Therabotics was created by a team of graduate students at Washington University in St. Louis to explore how computer vision can be used to improve prosthetic hand control.</p>\n<p>This project is a great demonstration of how to extend Pupil and contribute back to the open source community!</p>\n<div class=\"Feature-video-container-16by9\">\n  <iframe class=\"Feature-video u-padTop--2\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYcfLEvbxSc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"small u-padBottom--2\">Robotic Prosthetic Hand Controlled with Object Recognition and Eye-Tracking</div>\n\n<p>The object detection plugin publishes the detected object that is closest to the fixation to a rostopic. An Ardunio Mega 2560 subscribes to the rostopic and controls the linear actuators in an OpenBionics 3D printed hand to form a predefined grasp that is associated with the detected object.</p>\n<p>Check out Jesse’s Pupil fork on <a href=\"https://github.com/jesseweisberg/pupil\">github</a>. He provides a very well written readme along with demo videos. Or jump straight to his “object detector app” in his <a href=\"https://github.com/jesseweisberg/pupil/tree/master/pupil_src/shared_modules/object_detector_app\">repo</a>.</p>\n<p>We hope that others will build on top of Jesse’s work and contribute back to his project!</p>\n<p>Finally, if you have built something with Pupil, please consider sharing with the community via chat on <a href=\"https://pupil-labs.com/chat\">DiscordApp</a>.</p>\n","updatedAt":"2018-01-26T09:06:41.708Z","article":"2017-12_object_fixation"}]
